This is my (Uri Haran) git repository for the NLP course in TAU, 2023.
The repository will be used to store code for:
    Downloading NLP models,
    Downloading Datasets,
    Preprocessing Datasets for generality,
    Editing queries for different politeness levels,
    Processing queries through models for evaluation,
    Performing the previous actions through SLURM.
