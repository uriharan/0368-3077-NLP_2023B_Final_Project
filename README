This is my (Uri Haran) git repository for the NLP course in TAU, 2023.
The repository will be used to store code for:
    Downloading NLP models,
    Downloading Datasets,
    Processing Datasets for use in the models,
    Editing Datasets for testing variations on models,
    Running the original and the altered data on the models,
    Performing the previous actions through SLURM.
